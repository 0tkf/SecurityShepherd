login.label.about_blurb = The OWASP Security Shepherd project has been designed and implemented with the aim of fostering and improving application security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic.This project enables users to learn or to improve upon existing manual penetration testing skills. This is accomplished through lesson and challenge techniques. A lesson provides a user with a lot of help in completing that module, where a challenge puts what the user learned in the lesson to use. </p><p>The OWASP Security Shepherd project covers the OWASP Top Ten web app risks and also covers the OWASP Top Ten Mobile risks as well. Using these risks as a challenge test bed, common security vulnerabilities can be explored and their impact on a system understood. Many of these levels include insufficient mitigations and protections to these risks, such as blacklist filters, atrocious encoding schemes, barbaric security mechanisms and poor security configuration. The modules have been crafted to provide not only a challenge for a security novice, but security professionals as well.
